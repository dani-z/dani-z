## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Happy to see you here

### What I do
I am a senior software engineer, focusing on React, React Native, GraphQL, node.

Currently working with [@CarlsbergGBS](https://github.com/CarlsbergGBS).

Have an idea and need help building it? Send me an email at hello@dzaremba.com and we can chat

When I'm not coding I like to spend time in nature with the camera in hand.

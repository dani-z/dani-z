## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Happy to see you here

### What I do
Founder of [Pixel Bucket](https://pxbucket.com), senior software consultant, focusing on emerging technologies and helping companies build awesome products.

Tech tools: React, React Native, GraphQL, node, blockchain

Currently helping [@CarlsbergGBS](https://github.com/CarlsbergGBS) build some amazing products.

Have an idea and need help building it? Send me an email at hello@pxbucket.com and we can chat

When I'm not coding I like to spend time in nature with the camera in hand.
